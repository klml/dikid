dikid is a draft for a Issue_tracking_system written using couchapp with CouchDB (no extra webserver, no extra script). 

It shows the user sheets like pieces of paper, and bunches of sheets (for relationships )

And lets you create and change them.

There are no comments, just create a new sheet as followup.
To create a new sheet just input some text, like an email.
