dikid is a draft for a Issue_tracking_system written using couchapp with CouchDB (no extra webserver, no extra serverscript). 

Its based on 'sheets' like pieces of paper, and 'bunches' of these sheets for relationships (like queues, users, projects, parents and childs etc)

There are no comments, just create a new sheet as followup-sheet.
To create a new sheet, just input some text, like an email.
